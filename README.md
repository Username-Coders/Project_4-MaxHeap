````
Implement method that builds a max heap using sequential insertions (Daniel Rodriguez, drodriguez97)
  => its time complexity: O(nlogn)
  => by successively applying the regular add method
  => needs to keep track of how many swaps (swapping parent and child) are required to build a heap
````

Already Completed
Implement method that builds a max heap using the optimal method (John Salinas, JohnSalinas123)
  => its time complexity: O(n)
  => the "smart" way we learned in class
  => needs to keep track of how many swaps (swapping parent and child) are required to build a heap
````

````
Already Completed
Implement the remove method of a max-heap (Real Name, Username)
````

````
Method that reads a sequence of integers from an iput file (Priscilla Ballesteros, PBallesteros02)
  => "data.txt"
    => This file contains 100 integers (no duplicates, and positive numbers)
    => Each line is an integer
  => Return some way to access these numbers, perhaps an array
````

### Performing heap operations:

````
Method that prints the first 10 integers of an array into an output file (John Salinas, JohnSalinas123)
    => This method is called once the Max Heap is created
    => "Heap built using sequential insertions: 100,94,99,77,93,98,61,68,76,84,..."
````

````
Method that prints number of swaps during Max Heap creation into output file (John Salinas, JohnSalinas123)
    => Number of swaps could be a private class variable that gets updated when Max Heap is created
    => "Number of swaps in the heap creation: 480"
````

````
Method that prints the first 10 integers of an array into outputfile (John Salinas, JohnSalinas123)
    => This method is called after 10 removals
    => "Heap after 10 removals: 90,89,63,79,88,55,62,71,78,87,..."

#### Make sure to reference example output from Project 4 instructions
    => The numbers above are just example output from instructions
